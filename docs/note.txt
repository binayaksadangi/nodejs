MODULES

we import the file using require function and path name.
if we log the req value it will return an empty object.
If we have exported something from the module then it will show taht value.
we can expoet multiple things from one file as an object.
we have different built in modules in Node.js like OS,filesystem.

FILE SYSTEM
used to read write create files
all the codes explained in file.js

Stream and buffer

when we try to read a large file in the async fun it will take a long time
instade of that we use buffers. when the buffer is full we give it to the user and like wise 
we maintatin a stream of buffers.

use createReadStream to create a buffer stream
then on rs.on(data) it will return the buffer taht got recived and print on the window
